The problem I'm presenting to you my version of the producer consumer problem is based upon a pizzeria.

So you have a pizzeria which has some people who make pizzas and that will be the producer in our producer consumer problem.

Then we have a customer, one or more customers who at fairly regular intervals will place orders and they're the consumers.

So they place the order.

The order goes to the pizzeria, they try to make the pizza.

Something might go wrong, somebody might quit, they might run out of an ingredient, whatever the case may be, but they'll try to make the pizza.

And our goal here is to ensure that we write a solution to the producer consumer problem.

Now, that's a very general description, but as we go through, you'll see just how complex this problem can be.
